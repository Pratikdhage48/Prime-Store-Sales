4. Features / Highlights

    Retail chains operate across multiple locations with varied product mixes and customer demographics. Analyzing which stores are underperforming, which categories drive revenue, or how discounts impact profit      is time-consuming without an effective data visualization tool.

Key questions include:

Which regions are the top performers in terms of sales and profitability?

Which product categories have the highest returns or lowest margins?

What is the sales trend over different time periods?

How do customer demographics influence buying behavior?

  • Tracks store-level and product-level performance across time.

  • Highlights sales trends, discounts, and profitability metrics.
